This directory contains scripts to recreate results achieved by the paper "Modeling Compute Storage Quality of Service and
Latency using Sigmoid Functions" (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9937953).

The resulting parametrized function can be used in simulators to approximate latency values of SSDs.
